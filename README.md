- 👋 Hi, I’m @MimBikarska88
- 👀 I’m interested in natural sciences, music, outdoor activities and reading. (Not mentioning programming) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering at TU-VARNA. I regularly enroll different courses at Softuni too. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting since I aspire to learn as much as I can and put those skills in practice ASAP!
